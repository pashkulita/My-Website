                    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>During my free time, I like to draw. I've always had a passion and liking for drawing and art. This passion partly lead me to choose Interactive Multimedia Design as my major. I also love to read, particularly manga, and love to watch anime as well. I also like playing piano, and have been self taught and practicing since I was young. I'm a huge gamer too. My favourite games are rhythm games such as osu! and Muse Dash, and RPGs such as Skyrim and Pokemon.</p>
